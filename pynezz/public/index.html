# Welcome to <span id="hostname" style="font-size: small;"></span>
*both sites are the same*

## What is <span id="hostname">pynezz.dev / pynezz.com</span>?

This site is a personal project by me ([pynezz](https://github.com/pynezz))
where I'm building a content management system (CMS) in [Go](https://go.dev/).

## $whoami

I've newly graduated with a bachelor's degree in cyber security,
and have a passion for programming and development.

This serves as a portfolio of my work, as well as thoughts, and ideas.

## What's next?

Aside from searching for a job, I'm developing this site to be a blog and portfolio.
As time passes, this site will gradually be updated with new content in the changelog section.

### Aim

This site starts off as a simple static site, I'm writing this "by hand".

The goal is to be able to upload markdown files to the server and have
them automatically converted to HTML and displayed on the site,
with correct formatting and styling.

I'm writing the server and client side code from scratch because it's fun to re-invent the wheel.

### Technologies used

- Reverse proxy with OpenResty (nginx) with some Lua scripting
- Go CMS server with SQLite database
- Authentication (undecided): maybe JWT, maybe OAuth,
    at least I'll use Argon2 if I need to store credentials...
- Frontend (planned): Go-Templ
- Markdown to HTML conversion: undecided
- Temporary hosting: DigitalOcean
