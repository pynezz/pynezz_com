<section><h2>What is pynezz.dev?</h2>
<p>If you're reading this, the site is up and running!</p>
<p>This means that:</p>
<p>- The server is running (Go)</p>
<p>- The reverse proxy is working (<a href="https://openresty.org/">OpenResty</a>)</p>
<p>- The client side code is working (<a href="https://templ.guide">Go-Templ</a>)</p>
<p>- The markdown to HTML conversion is working (built from scratch)</p>
<p>- The database is working (SQLite)</p>
<p>- The authentication is working (<a href="https://jwt.io/">JWTs</a> or <a href="https://paseto.io">PASETO</a>, implemented myself)</p>
<p>- The domain is working (pynezz.dev)</p>
<p>- SSL is working (<a href="https://letsencrypt.org">Let's Encrypt</a>)</p>
<p>This site is a personal project by me</p>
<p>(<a href="https://github.com/pynezz">pynezz</a>)</p>
<p>where I'm building a content management</p>
<p>system (CMS) in <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>.</p>

<section><h2>$whoami</h2>
<p>I've newly graduated with a bachelor's degree in cyber security,</p>
<p>and have a passion for programming and development.</p>
<p>This serves as a portfolio of my work,</p>
<p>as well as thoughts, and ideas.</p>
</section>
<section><h2>What's next?</h2>
<p>Aside from searching for a job,</p>
<p>I'm developing this site to be a blog and portfolio.</p>
<p>As time passes, this site will gradually be updated</p>
<p>with new content in the changelog section.</p>
</section>
<section><h3>Aim</h3>
<p>This site starts off as a simple static site, I'm writing this "by hand".</p>
<p>The goal is to be able to upload markdown files to the server and have</p>
<p>them automatically converted to HTML and displayed on the site,</p>
<p>with correct formatting and styling.</p>
<p>I'm writing the server and client side code from scratch</p>
<p>because it's fun to re-invent the wheel.</p>
</section>
<section><h3>Technologies used</h3>
<p>- Reverse proxy with OpenResty (nginx) with some Lua scripting</p>
<p>- Go CMS server with SQLite database</p>
<p>- Authentication (undecided): maybe JWT (current), or maybe <a href="https://paseto.io">PASETO</a>,</p>
<p>at least I'll use Argon2 if I need to store credentials...</p>
<p>- Frontend: Go-Templ</p>
<p>- Markdown to HTML conversion: built from scratch</p>
<p>- Hosting: DigitalOcean, but any VPS will do</p>
